     * <ul>
     * <li> a field having the same type as the dependency. If the field may be accessed by anythread, then
     * the field should be declared volatile, in order to ensure visibility when the field is auto injected concurrently.
     * 
     * <li> a field which is assignable to an <code>Iterable&#60;T&#62;</code> where T must match the dependency type. 
     * In this case, an Iterable will be injected by DependencyManager before the start callback is called.
     * The Iterable field may then be traversed to inspect the currently available dependency services. The Iterable 
     * can possibly be set to a final value so you can choose the Iterable implementation of your choice
     * (for example, a CopyOnWrite ArrayList, or a ConcurrentLinkedQueue).
     * 
     * <li> a <code>Map&#60;K,V&#62;</code> where K must match the dependency type and V must exactly equals <code>Dictionary</code>. 
     * In this case, a ConcurrentHashMap will be injected by DependencyManager before the start callback is called.
     * The Map may then be consulted to lookup current available dependency services, including the dependency service
     * properties (the map key holds the dependency service, and the map value holds the dependency service properties).
     * 
     * The Map field may be set to a final value so you can choose a Map of your choice (Typically a ConcurrentHashMap).
     * 
     * A ConcurrentHashMap is "weakly consistent", meaning that when traversing 
     * the elements, you may or may not see any concurrent updates made on the map. So, take care to traverse 
     * the map using an iterator on the map entry set, which allows to atomically lookup pairs of Dependency service/Service properties.
