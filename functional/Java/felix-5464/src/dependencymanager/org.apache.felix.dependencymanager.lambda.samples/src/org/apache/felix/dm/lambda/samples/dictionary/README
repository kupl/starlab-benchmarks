This sample shows a "SpellChecker" application which provides a
"dictionary:spellcheck" GOGO shell command. The GOGO "dictionary:spellcheck" command accepts a
string as parameter, which is checked for proper exactness. The SpellChecker class has a
required/multiple (1..N) dependency over every available "DictionaryService" services, which are
internally used by the SpellChecker command, when checking word exactness.

A DictionaryService is defined using a FactoryConfigurationAdapterService , allowing to instantiate
many "DictionaryService" instances for each configuration that are added to the
factory pid "Spell Checker Configuration" from web console.
The factory pid configuration metatypes are defined using the bnd "metatype" annotations
(see DictionaryConfiguration.java).

The DictionaryService is decorated with a DictionaryAspect, which you can instantiate by adding a
configuration to the "Spell Checker Aspect Dictionary" pid from web console. The
aspect configuration metatype is also declared using the bnd metatype annotations (see
DictionaryAspectConfiguration.java). 

Before running this sample, go to webconsole, and add some words in the "Spell Checker Configuration"factory PID, and
in the "Spell Checker Dictionary Aspect" PID.

Then go to gogo shell, and type dm help. You will normally see the dictionary:spellcheck command.
Type dictionary:spellcheck <some words configured either in the spell checker configuration, or in the spell checker aspect configuration, 
and the dictionary will check for proper word exactness in the configuration.
