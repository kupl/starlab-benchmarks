This sample provides a DM Activator declaring an "HelloService" on which an HelloClient component is depending on.
The HelloClient component also optionally depends on the LogService, which is injected as a NullObject in case
no LogService is currently available.

Run the hello.bndrun and you should see the following output:

Hello service starting
HelloClient bound with HelloService.
hello !
