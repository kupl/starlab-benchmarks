This Activator is an example usage of DM composite. A composite component is implemented
using a composition of multiple object instances, which are used to implement a given service. 

The sample also uses a Factory approach in order to instantiate the composition of objects: A
"CompositionManager" is first injected with a Configuration that can possibly be used to create
and configure all the composites.

Dependencies are injected in all objects in the composition.

To test, run click on "compositefactory.bndrun" descriptor, and run it, then type "log warn" in gogo shell: 

g! log warn
