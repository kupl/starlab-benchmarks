This sample shows a "SpellChecker" application (using DM API) which provides a
"dictionary:spellcheck" GOGO shell command. The GOGO "dictionary:spellcheck" command accepts a
string as parameter, which is checked for proper existence. The SpellChecker class has a
required/multiple (1..N) dependency over every available "DictionaryService" services, which are
internally used by the SpellChecker command, when checking word existence.

A DictionaryService is defined using a FactoryConfigurationAdapterService , allowing to instantiate
many "DictionaryService" instances when some configurations are added to the
"Spell Checker Configuration" factory pid from web
console. The factory pid configuration metatypes are defined using the bnd "metatype" annotations
(see DictionaryConfiguration.java).

The DictionaryService is decorated with a DictionaryAspect, which you can instantiate by adding a
configuration to the "Spell Checker Aspect Dictionary" pid from web console. The
aspect configuration metatype is also declared using the bnd metatype annotations (see
DictionaryAspectConfiguration.java). 

Start the test: click on "dictionary.api.bndrun" descriptor, and run it.
Then go to webconsole (http://localhost:8080/system/console/configMgr), and add some words in the 
"Spell Checker Dictionary" section, and in the "Spell Checker Aspect Dictionary" configurations.

Then go to gogo shell, and type dm help. You will normally see the dictionary.annotation:spellcheck command.
Then type:
 
   spellcheck <some words that you have configured in webconsole>

and the command will check for proper word existence.
