This directory contains an example of a custom dependency (PathDependency).
This dependency tracks all created files in /tmp and injects them in the PathTracker.add(String path) method ...

The PathDependendency is a low level DM example, but shows how to create any custom dependencies.

To test this sample, start the "customdep.bndrun" descriptor, then create a file in /tmp:

   $ echo "test" > /tmp/foo

Then display logs (your Tracker component has normally been injected with the added file and has been started):

   g! log warn
