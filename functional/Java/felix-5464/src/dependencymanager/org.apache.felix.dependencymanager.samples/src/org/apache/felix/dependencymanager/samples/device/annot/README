This is an example showing a Dependency Manager "Adapter" in action, using DM annotations. Two kinds
of services are registered in the registry: some Device, and some DeviceParameter services. For each
Device (having a given id), there is also a corresponding "DeviceParameter" service, having the same
id.

Then a "DeviceAccessImpl" adapter service is defined: it is used to "adapt" the "Device" service to
a "DeviceAccess" service, which provides the union of each pair of Device/DeviceParameter having the
same device.id . The adapter also dynamically propagate the service properties of the adapted Device
service.

Start the test by clicking on the "device.annot.bndrun" descriptor, then run it, and type under gogo shell:
