This is an example showing a Dependency Manager "Adapter" in action. Two kinds of services are
registered in the registry: some Device, and some DeviceParameter services. For each Device (having
a given id), there is also a corresponding "DeviceParameter" service, having the same id.

Then a "DeviceAccessImpl" adapter service is defined: it is used to "adapt" the "Device" service to
a "DeviceAccess" service, which provides the union of each pair of Device/DeviceParameter having the
same device.id . The adapter also dynamically propagate the service properties of the adapted Device
service.

Start the test by clicking on the "device.api.bndrun" descriptor, then run it, and type under gogo shell:

g! log warn

You will then see:
