  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>REST web services have become the number one means for application
  integration on the web. In its core, REST defines that a system consists of
  resources that clients interact with. These resources are implemented in a
  hypermedia drive way. Spring MVC offers a solid foundation to build theses
  kinds of services but implementic very basic functionality of REST web
  service can be tedious and result in a lot of boilderplate code.</para>

  <para>Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories and
  automatically exports those as REST resources. It leverages hypermedia to
  allow clients to find functionality exposed by the repositories and allows
  to integrate the resources into related hypermedia based functionality as
  easy as possible.</para>
