0.4.0
License

The license hase been updated to GPL version 3.

Installation

The package has been updated with newer gettext, automake, and autoconf.
The use of GUILE is optional, but it's a good idea.  I added a check on
the configuration to see if libguile.h had been found to decide whether 
to run the GUILE-specific configuration.  If it doesn't work for you, 
please send a bug report, including information about your system, and 
what error you got.

Documentation

There have been small updates fixing typos and making things more readable.

0.3.4
Bugs

Corrected memory leaks in temporary key values when processing matches 
between files.

Functionality

A field delimiter specified for the data file is now used as the input field 
delimiter for any reference files and as the output field delimiter for any
reference files.  This can be stopped by specifying a different delimiter for
one or more files or by using the new options --no-input-field-delimiter or 
--no-output-field-delimiter to specify no-delimiter (fixed format) treatment.

Installation

The package has been re-configured so that we are using the latest
versions of gettext, autoconf, and automake.  As a result, the right
files and the right versions should be installed.  -- Reported by
