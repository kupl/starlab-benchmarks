1.1 Introduction
================

`combine' is primarily a program for merging files on a common key.
While such things as table joins on keys are common in database systems
like MySQL, there seems to be a marked failure in the availability for
such processing on text files.  `combine' is intended to fill that gap.

   Another way of looking at `combine' is as the kernel of a database
system without all the overhead (and safeguards) associated with such
systems.  The missing baggage that appeals most to me is the requirement
to load data into somebody else's format before working with it.
`combine''s design is intended to allow it to work with most data
directly from the place where it already is.

   In looking around for existing software that wanted to do what I
wanted to do, the closest I came was the `join' utility in GNU and other
operating systems.  `join' has some limitations that I needed to
overcome.  In particular, in matching it works on only one field each
in only two files.  For such a match, on files whose fields are
separated by a delimiter, I'm sure that join is a more efficient choice.
Someday I'll test that assumption.

   Once I started writing the program, I had to come up with a name.
Given that one of the earliest applications that I imagined for such a
program would be to prepare data for storage in a data warehouse, I
thought to where the things that are stored in physical warehouses come
from.  At that point, I came up with the name DataFactory.
Unfortunately, just as I got ready to release it, I noticed that
someone else has that as a registered trademark.

   As a result, I have come up with the name `combine'.  Like the farm
implement of the same name, this program can be used to separate the
wheat from the chaff.  I also like it because it has a similarity to
`join' reminiscent of the similarity of function.

1.1.1 Ways to Use `combine'
---------------------------

Here are some almost real-world applications of `combine' that may whet
your imagination for your own uses.

* Menu:

* Encrypted Data::
* Data Validation::


File: combine.info,  Node: Encrypted Data,  Next: Data Validation,  Up: Ways to Use combine

1.1.1.1 Encrypted Data
......................

Suppose you have a file that you would normally want to keep encrypted
(say, your customer information, which includes their credit card
numbers).  Suppose further that you occasionally receive updates of some
less sensitive information about the customers.

   To update the sensitive file, you could unencrypt the file, load all
the data from both files into a database, merge the data, extract the
result from the database (making sure to wipe the disk storage that was
used), and re-encrypt.  That leaves the information open to DBAs and
the like during the process, and it sure seems like a lot of steps.

   Using `combine' and your favorite encryption program, the data never
has to touch the disk unencrypted (except in a swap file) so casual
observers are unlikely to run across sensitive information.  In addition
an updated encrypted file can be created in one command line, piping the
input and output of the sensitive data through your encryption program.

   Here's a sample command that might do the trick.

     gpg -d < secret_file \
     | combine -w -o 1-300 \
                   -r update_information -k 1-10 -m 1-10 -o 11-20 -p \
     | gpg -e > updated_secret_file


File: combine.info,  Node: Data Validation,  Prev: Encrypted Data,  Up: Ways to Use combine

1.1.1.2 Data Validation
.......................

Another example that is often important when receiving data from the
outside world is data validation.

   Perhaps you receive product sales data from a number of retailers,
which you need to combine with product information you have elsewhere.
To confirm that the file you received is valid for reporting, you might
need to check the product codes, ZIP codes, and retailer codes against
your known valid values.

   All the comparisons can be done in a single command, which will
result in a status which will flag us down if anything did not match to
our lists of expected values.

     combine -w -o 1- \
                 -r products.txt -k 1-18 -m 11-28 \
                 -r zip.txt -k 1-5 -m 19-23 \
                 -r customer.txt -k 1-10 -m 1-10 \
                 input.txt \
       | cmp input.txt
     result=$?

   That's probably enough if we are pretty sure that the incoming data
is usually clean.  If something does not match up, we can investigate by
hand.  On the other hand, if we expect to find differences a little more
frequently, we can make some small changes.

   The following command makes the match optional, but puts a constant
'$' at the end of the record for each match among the three keys to be
validated.  When there isn't a match, `combine' puts a space into the
record in place of the '$'.  We can then search for something other
than '$$$' at the end of the record to know which records didn't match.

     combine -w -o 1- \
                 -r products.txt -k 1-18 -m 11-28 -k '$' -p \
                 -r zip.txt -k 1-5 -m 19-23 -k '$' -p \
                 -r customer.txt -k 1-10 -m 1-10 -k '$' -p \
                 input.txt \
       | grep -v '\$\$\$$' > input.nomatch

1.2 Reporting Bugs
==================

When you find a bug, please be so kind to report it in a way that will
help the maintainer to understand why it is a bug and how to make it
happen (so that the correction can be tested).  The information
necessary to make such a determination will include such things as a
description of the symptoms (not just your impression of the cause), the
command line you used to run the program, the options that were used
when building the program, and anything else that you are not absolutely
sure is irrelevant.  You can also include the things that you are
absolutely sure are irrelevant, as one is often sure without good
reason.

   Thank you for taking advantage of this free software.  Your
information on bugs in your use of the software are very valuable in
keeping it as useful as possible for all users.  Please report bugs to

2 Invoking `combine'
********************

`combine' is invoked with the command

   `combine [general options | data file options]... [reference file
options]... [data files]'

   The various options are described in the following sections.

   The arguments to the command are data files, an optional list of file
names to be processed or nothing, indicating that the input will come
from `stdin'.

* Menu:

* General Options::
* File Options::
* Data Files::
* Reference Files::
* Output Files::
* Field Specifiers::
* Emulation::


File: combine.info,  Node: General Options,  Next: File Options,  Prev: Invoking combine,  Up: Invoking combine

2.1 General Options
===================

The general options are not specific to any particular file and apply to
the entire current run of the program.  They are listed below.

`-R'
`--check-all-reference'
`--no-check-all-reference'
     For each data record, check for a match with each of the reference
     files.  This option is set by default.  When turned off with
     `--no-check-all-reference', processing of that data file record
     will be stopped as soon as a required match is not fulfilled.
     This is a shortcut for speed, but it will change the meaning of
     any flags or counters set in reference-file-based input.

`-f'
`--flag'
     In any output based on a reference file, print a flag with the
     value `1' if the record was matched by a data record or `0'
     otherwise.

`-n'
`--count'
     In any output based on a reference file, print a new field which
     is a count of the number of data records that matched the current
     reference record.

`-z NUMBER'
`--counter-size=NUMBER'
     If counters or sums of data fields are being written into
     reference-based output, make them NUMBER bytes long.

`--statistics'
`--no-statistics'
     At the end of the processing, write to `stderr' counts of the
     number of records read and matched from each file processed.  The
     option is enabled by default.  When turned off with
     `--no-statistics' print no statistics.

`--verbose'
     Write all the information that is possible about the processing to
     `stderr'.  This includes a summary of the options that have been
     set and running counters of the number of records processed.



File: combine.info,  Node: File Options,  Next: Data Files,  Prev: General Options,  Up: Invoking combine

2.2 File Options
================

There are some attributes that apply to any file.  They include such
things as the way to tell one record from another, the way to identify
fields within a record, and the fields in a file that you want to write
out.

`-d STRING'
`--output-field-delimiter=STRING'
     Print STRING between each pair of fields written to output files.
     This can be a comma, a tab character, your mother's maiden name,
     or the full text of the GNU General Public License.  It is your
     choice.  Of course, it is most useful for it to be something that
     would not normally occur in your data fields and something that
     your target system will understand.  Because `combine' doesn't
     care about such things, you can even use the null character (`\0')
     or the newline character (`\n').

`--no-output-field-delimiter'
     This means that there is to be no delimiter between fields in the
     output file or files.  It will prevent the input field delimiter
     from being taken as the output field delimiter.  In cases like
     this, it might behoove you either to ensure that the fields have a
     fixed length or to use Guile to insert your own delimiters before
     they are written.  When specified along with
     `--output-field-delimiter', the option that appears later will
     override the prior one.

`-b STRING'
`--output-record-delimiter=STRING'
     Similarly here STRING is whatever string you need to use to tell
     the records apart in output files.  If you don't specify it,
     `combine' will assume that the usual text format applies, the
     newline on GNU operating systems.  (As of this writing, no port
     has been made to systems where a newline is not the standard
     end-of-line character.)

`-D STRING'
`--input-field-delimiter=STRING'
     Look for STRING in the associated input file to determine where
     fields start and end.  It can be any string, but it should be the
     string that really separates fields in your file.  Because
     `combine' doesn't care about such things, you can even use the
     null character (`\0') or the newline character (`\n').  At
     present, there is no interpretation of quoted strings.  As a
     result, you may get unexpected results if the delimiter shows up
     in the middle of one of your fields.

     When specified for the data file, the value specified is used as
     the input field delimiter for all reference files and as the
     output field delimiter for any output files, unless other action
     is taken.  The options `--no-input-field-delimiter' and
     `--no-output-field-delimiter' will tell `combine' that a given
     file should not have a delimiter.  The options
     `--input-field-delimiter' and `--output-field-delimiter' will use
     whatever delimiter you specify rather than the data file input
     field delimiter.

`--no-input-field-delimiter'
     This means that there is no delimiter between fields in the
     specified input file or files.  It will prevent the data file
     input field delimiter from being taken as the input field
     delimiter for a reference file.  When specified along with
     `--output-field-delimiter', the option that appears later will
     override the prior one.

`-B STRING'
`--input-record-delimiter=STRING'
     Similarly here STRING is whatever string you need to use to tell
     the records apart in input files.  If you don't specify it,
     `combine' will assume that the usual text format applies, the
     newline on GNU operating systems.

`-L NUMBER'
`--input-record-length=NUMBER'
     If the records are all of the same length (whether of not there is
     a linefeed or a `W' between them), you can specify a record length.
     `combine' will then split the file into records all of exactly
     NUMBER bytes long.  If there are linefeeds or carriage returns
     between records, be sure to add them to the count.  If the length
     is not specified, `combine' will assume the records have a
     delimiter between them.

`-p'
`--match-optional'
     Make it unnecessary to find a match to this file for inclusion in
     data file based output and for the further processing of a data
     record.  All matches are required by default.

     When applied to a reference file, this means that records based on
     a data record may be written without a match to a key in this
     reference file, and any output from fields in this file will be
     left blank (or substituted if specified with the `-O' option).

     When applied to a data file, this means that in the file based on
     the data file records, records will be written at the end of
     processing for reference file records that were not matched by a
     data file record.  Any output specified from fields in the data
     file will be left blank (or substituted if specified with the `-O'
     option).  If there is more than one reference file, care should be
     taken, because the unmatched records from each reference file will
     each become a record in the output file.  This has no effect on
     reference-file-based output.

`-P'
`--exclude-match'
     Require no match to this file for inclusion in data file based
     output and for the further processing of a data record.  All
     matches are required and included by default.  This differs from
     `--match-optional' in that records that do have a match are
     excluded from further consideration.

     When applied to a reference file, this means that records based on
     a data record may only be written when there is no match to a key
     in this reference file, and any output from fields in this file
     will be left blank (or substituted if specified with the `-O'
     option).

     When applied to a data file, this means that in the file based on
     the data file records, records will only be written at the end of
     processing for reference file records that were not matched by a
     data file record.  Any output specified from fields in the data
     file will be left blank (or substituted if specified with the `-O'
     option).  If there is more than one reference file, care should be
     taken, because the unmatched records from each reference file will
     each become a record in the output file.  This has no effect on
     reference-file-based output.



File: combine.info,  Node: Data Files,  Next: Reference Files,  Prev: File Options,  Up: Invoking combine

2.3 Data Files
==============

A data file is either `stdin', one or more files, or both.  If there is
more than one source, they should all share a format that fits the
specifications provided for output fields, fields holding numeric
values to be summed, and fields to be used as keys for matching.

   The following are the commands that specifically affect the
processing of the data file.  Some share the same name with options
that can also apply to reference files.  Those must be on your command
line before you present your first reference file.  The others could
appear anywhere on the command line; however, convention dictates that
all the data-file options should be together before the first reference
file is named.

`-w'
`--write-output'
     Signals the program that output records should be written every
     time a data record satisfies the matching criteria with the
     reference files.  The record written will combine all specified
     output fields from the data file record, the matching reference
     file record(s), and any specified constant values.  This option is
     a positional option for all files, and must appear before the
     first reference file is named.

`-t FILENAME'
`--output-file=FILENAME'
     If provided, write the data-based output to FILENAME.  Otherwise
     the output will go to `stdout'.  This option only makes sense if
     you plan to write data-file-based output.  This is a positional
     option for all files and must appear before the first reference
     file is named.

`-o RANGE_STRING'
`--output-fields=RANGE_STRING'
     Write the fields specified by RANGE_STRING as part of the record
     in any data-based output.  The range specifications share a common
     format with all field specifications for `combine'.  This option
     only makes sense if you plan to write data-file-based output.
     This is a positional option and to apply to the data file it must
     appear before the first reference file is named.

`-K STRING'
`--output-constant=STRING'
     Write STRING to the data-file-based output.  This option only
     makes sense if you plan to write data-file-based output.  This is a
     positional option and to apply to the data file it must appear
     before the first reference file is named.

`-s RANGE_STRING'
`--sum-fields=RANGE_STRING'
     In any reference-file-based output write a sum of the value of the
     fields specified by RANGE_STRING.  The sum for a given reference
     file record will come from all data file records that matched it.
     This option only makes sense if you have requested
     reference-file-based output.

     If a precision is provided for a sum field, that precision is
     honored, and decimal fractions up to that many digits will be
     included in the sum.  Any further precision on the input fields
     will be ignored (without rounding) in the sum.  The resulting sum
     will be written with a decimal point and the number of fractional
     digits implied by the precision.

2.4 Reference Files
===================

A reference file record is expected to match on a set of key fields to a
data file record.  The parts of a reference file that are necessary for
processing are read entirely into memory.  You can specify as many
reference files as you want, depending only on the amount of memory your
system can spare to hold them.  For any reference file, it is minimally
required that you specify a file name, a specification of the key fields
in the reference file, and a specification of the matching key fields in
the data file.

   The following are the options that are related to reference files.
They are all positional, and they apply to the processing of the
previously named reference file.  (Except of course for the reference
file name itself, which applies to itself.)

`-r FILENAME'
`--reference-file=FILENAME'
     Use FILENAME as a reference file to match to the data file in
     processing.  This option introduces a block of positional options
     that relate to this reference file's processing in `combine'.

`-k RANGE_STRING'
`--key-fields=RANGE_STRING'
     Use the fields specified by RANGE_STRING as a key to match to a
     corresponding key in the data file.

`-m RANGE_STRING'
`--data-key-fields=RANGE_STRING'
     Use the fields specified by RANGE_STRING as the corresponding key
     to a key taken from a reference file.

`-a RANGE_STRING'
`--hierarchy-key-fields=RANGE_STRING'
     Use the fields specified by RANGE_STRING as a key to perform a
     recursive hierarchical match within the reference file.  This key
     will be matched against values specified in the regular key on the
     reference file.

`-u'
`--unique'
     Keep only one record for the reference file in memory for each
     distinct key.  By default `combine' maintains all the records from
     the reference file in memory for processing.  This default allows
     for cartesian products when a key exists multiple times in both the
     reference and data files.

`-h NUMBER'
`--hash-size=NUMBER'
     Use the NUMBER provided as a base size for allocating a hash table
     to store the records from this reference file.  If this number is
     too small, `combine' will fail when it tries to record a record it
     has no room for.  If it is only a little bit too small, it will
     cause inefficiency as searching for open space in the hash table
     will be difficult.

`-H KEYWORD'
`--hash-movement=KEYWORD'
     One of the keywords `binary', `number', `beginning', or `end',
     indicating how to turn the key into a number with the best
     variability and least overlap.  The wise choice of this option can
     cut processing time significantly.  The binary option is the
     default, and treats the last few bytes (8 on most computers) of
     the key string(s) as a big number.  The number option converts the
     entire key to a number assuming it is a numeric string.  The other
     two take the least significant 3 bits from each of the first or
     last few (21 where a 64 bit integer is available) bytes in the key
     strings and turns them into a number.

`-w'
`--write-output'
     Signals the program that output records should be written for every
     record stored for this reference file.  This will either be one
     record for every record in the reference file or one record for
     every distinct set of keys in the reference file, depending on the
     setting of the option `--unique'.  The record written will include
     all specified output fields from the reference file record, any
     specified constant value for this reference file, and any flag,
     counter, or sums requested.

`-t FILENAME'
`--output-file=FILENAME'
     If provided, write the output based on this reference file to
     FILENAME.  Otherwise the output will go to `stdout'.  This option
     only makes sense if you plan to write output based on this
     reference file.

`-o RANGE_STRING'
`--output-fields=RANGE_STRING'
     Write the fields specified by RANGE_STRING as part of the record
     in any reference-file- or data-file-based output.  The range
     specifications share a common format with all field specifications
     for `combine'.

`-K STRING'
`--output-constant=STRING'
     Write STRING to the reference- or data-file-based output.

`-U'
`--up-hierarchy'
     When traversing the hierarchy from a given reference-file record,
     use the values on that record in the `--hierarchy-key-fields'
     fields to connect to the `--key-fields' fields of other records
     from the reference file.  For most purposes, the presence of the
     connection on the first record suggests a single parent in a
     standard hierarchy.  The hierarchy traversal stops when the
     `--hierarchy-key-fields' fields are empty.

     If this option is not set, the `--key-fields' fields are used to
     search for the same values in the `--hierarchy-key-fields' fields
     of other records in the same file.  This allows multiple children
     of an initial record, and suggests going down in the hierarchy.
     The hierarchy traversal stops when no further connection can be
     made.  The traversal is depth-first.

`-l'
`--hierarchy-leaf-only'
     When traversing a hierarchy, treat only the endpoints as matching
     records.  Nodes that have onward connections are ignored except
     for navigating to the leaf nodes.

`-F NUMBER'
`--flatten-hierarchy=NUMBER'
     When traversing a hierarchy, act as the `hierarchy-leaf-only',
     except save information about the intervening nodes.  Repeat the
     `output-fields' fields NUMBER times (leaving them blank if there
     were fewer levels), starting from the first reference record
     matched.

2.5 Output Files
================

There are two basic kinds of output files: one based on the data records
and reference records that match them, the other based on a full set of
records from one reference file with flags, counts, or sums based on the
aggregate of the matching data records.

   The output file based on the data file consists of information from
the data file records and any matching reference file records.  The
records that go into data-based output files can be figured out as
follows:

no reference file
     If there is no reference file, there will be one record for every
     record in the data file, with the exception of any records that
     were elimitated through an extension filter. (*note Extending
     combine::.)

reference files with `--unique' and `--match-optional' options
     If all reference files are specified with the `--unique' and
     `--match-optional' options, then the records selected for insertion
     into the data-based output file will be the same as those that
     would be selected without a reference file.

reference files without the `--unique' option
     If a reference file is not given the `--unique' option and there
     is more than one reference record that matches a given data
     record, then the data record will be represented more than once in
     the output file, each time combined with information from a
     different matching reference record.  If there is more than one
     reference file where this is the case, the result will be
     multiplicative (e.g. 2 matches in each of 2 reference files will
     produce 4 records).  This is the default setting for a reference
     file.

reference files without the `--match-optional' option
     If a reference file is not given the `--match-optional' option,
     then any data record that does not have a match in the reference
     file will not be represented in the output file.  This is the
     default setting.

   The fields that can appear in data=file-based output can come from
the data-file record and any matching reference file records.

   Reference=file-based output files are simpler.  Depending on the
existence or not of the `--unique' option, the file will have an entry
for each of the unique keys or for each of the records in the reference
file, respectively.

   The fields in the reference=file-based output are exclusively from
the reference file, except for optional fields that can be summarized
from fields on matching data-file records.

   The order of the fields in an output record can either be according
to the default or it can be explicitly specified by the user.

   In data=file-based output, the standard field order is as follows.
All the fields listed are printed in this order if they are specified.
If an output field delimiter is specified, it is put between every pair
of adjacent fields.  If there is no match for a given reference file
(and the `--match-optional' option is set for the file), all the fields
that would normally be provided by that file are filled with spaces for
fixed-width fields or zero-length for delimited output.

   * All the data-file output fields (in order)

   * The constant string set for the data file

   * For each reference file

        - The constant string set for the reference file

        - All the reference-file output fields


   In reference=file-based output, the standard field order is as
follows.  All the fields listed are printed in this order if they are
specified.  If an output field delimiter is specified, it is put
between every pair of adjacent fields.

   * All the reference-file output fields OR the key fields if no
     output fields are given

   * A 1/0 flag indicating whether there was any match

   * A counter of the number of data records matched

   * A sum of each of the data-file sum fields from each matching
     data-file record

   The order of the fields in any output file can be customized using
the `--field-order' (or `-O') option.  The argument for the option is a
comma-separated list of field identifiers.  Each field identifier has 2
parts, a source and a type, separated by a period (.).

   The sources are composed of an `r' for reference file or `d' for
data file followed by an optional number.  The number indicates which
reference file the field comes from and is ignored for data files.
Without a number, the first of each is taken.

   A third source `s' represents a substitution in the event that the
preceding reference file field could not be provided because there was
no match between that reference file and the data file.  The number
following it, if blank or zero, tells `combine' to take the field from
the data file.  Any other number means the corresponding reference file.
This allows the conditional update of fields from the data file, or a
prioritization of selections from a variety of reference files.  If you
are working with fixed-width fields, you should ensure that the lengths
of the various fields in the substitution chain are the same.

   The types are composed similarly.  The identifiers are listed below.
The number is ignored for identifiers of string constants, flags, and
counters.  For output fields, a hyphen-separated range of fields can be
written to avoid having to write a long list.  Any number provided is
the number of the field in the order it was specified in the `-o' or
`-s' option on the command line.  In delimited-field files this may
differ from the field number used in those options.

`o'
     Output fields from either reference or data files.

`k'
     String constant for either reference or data files.

`f'
     Flag (1/0) for reference files.

`n'
     Counter for reference files.

`s'
     Sum field for reference files.


   Here is an example:

     --field-order d.o1,d.o2,d.o3,d.k,r1.o1,s2.o1,s0.o4

     --field-order d.o1-3,d.k,r1.o1,s2.o1,s0.o4

In this case, the first three fields from the data file are followed by
the constant string from the data file.  Then, if there was a match to
reference file 1, the first field from that file is taken, otherwise if
there was a match to reference file 2, the first field from that file is
taken.  If neither file matched the data record, the fourth field from
the data record is taken instead.

   The second line is equivalent, using a range of fields for
convenience.

2.6 Field Specifiers
====================

There are a number of options that require a list of fields from one of
the files.  All take an argument consisting of a comma-separated list of
individual field specifications.

   The individual field specifications are of the form
`s-e.p(instruction)'.  As a standard (with no field delimiter given for
the file), `s' is a number indicating the starting position of the
field within the records in th given file, and `e' is a number pointing
out the ending position.  If there is no hyphen, the single number `s'
represents a one-byte field at position `s'.  If the first number and a
hyphen exist without the number `e', then the field is assumed to start
at `s' and extend to the end of the record.  The numbering of the bytes
in the record starts at 1.

   If you do provide a delimiter for identifying the borders between
fields in your file, then `combine' does not need to count bytes, and
you just need to provide the field number (starting at 1) of the fields
you want to declare.  Currently, giving a range of fields results in
`combine' acting as though you listed every field from the lower end to
the upper end of the range individually.  Any precision or
extensibility information you provide will be applied to each field in
the range.

   The optional `.p' gives the number of digits of precision with which
the field should be considered.  At present its only practical use is
in fields to be summed from data files, where it is used in converting
between string and number formats.

   The optional `(instruction)' is intended for extensibility.  For
output fields and key fields it is a scheme command that should be run
when the field is read into the system.  If the associated field
specification is a key for matching reference and data records, this can
affect the way the records are matched.  If it is a field to be written
to an output file, it will affect what the user sees.

   To refer to the field actually read from the source data within the
scheme command, use the following sceme variable in the appropriate
place in the command: `input-field'

   Scheme commands attached to individual fields need to return a
character string and have available only the current text of the field
as described above(1).  In delimited output, feel free to alter the
length of the return string at will.  In fixed-width output, it will be
your responsibility to ensure that you return a string of a useful
length if you want to maintain the fixed structure.

   In the following string,

     1-10,15-20.2,30(HiMom input-field),40-

The fist field runs from position 1 to 10 in the record.  The second
from 15 to 20, with a stated (but possibly meaningless) precision of 2.
The third is the single byte at position 30, to be adjusted by
replacing it with whatever the scheme function `HiMom' does to it.  The
fourth field starts at position 40 and extends to the end of the record.

   In a delimited example, the following two sets of options are
equivalent.

     -D ',' -o 4,5,6,7,8
     -D ',' -o 4-8

In both cases the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
comma-delimited fields are each treated as an individual field for
processing.  Note that if you also provide a field order (with the `-O'
option), that order would refer to these fields as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
because of the order in which you specified them, not caring about the
order in the original file.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) That's not strictly true.  I discovered the other day that I can
create variables in some extension commands and then use them in a
subsequent command.  That requires a little documentation of the order
of processing so you get the values you want, but I haven't done that
yet.  For now, you can know that a set of field specifiers of the same
type (like output fields for reference file 1 or sum fields from the
data file) are processed in order.


File: combine.info,  Node: Emulation,  Prev: Field Specifiers,  Up: Invoking combine

2.7 Emulation
=============

Because of its simularity with `join', `combine' has an emulation mode
that allows you to use the syntax of the `join' command to start
`combine'.

   The emulation can be started by using `--emulate join' option as the
first option after the command name.  After that, you can use the same
options you get with join.

   For details of the `join' command, see *Note Join Invocation:
(coreutils.info)join invocation.  When tested against the test cases
packaged with GNU Coreutils, results are identical to join with a
couple of exceptions:

   * The sort order can be different.  `combine' produces records in
     the order of the second input file, with any unmatched records
     from the first input file following in an arbitrary order.

   * I change the arguments to the `-o' option in the test script to
     have quotes around the field order list when it is separated by
     spaces.  `combine' can handle the space-delimited list, but the
     standard argument handler `getopt_long' does not interpret them as
     a single argument.  I don't see the need to overcome that.

   * There is not a specific test, but I have not yet implemented
     case-insensitive matching.  It would have failed if tested.

   * One more option that is not implemented in the emulation are the
     `-j1' and `-j2' methods of specifying separate keys for the two
     files.  Use `-1' and `-2' for that.  The two obsolete options
     would be interpreted as speciying field 1 or field 2 as the common
     join key, respectively.


   There are also a number of features of `combine' that come through
in the emulation.  The main features relate to the keys: the sort order
of the records in relation to the keys does not matter to `combine'.
`combine' also allows you to specify a list of key fields
(comma-delimited) rather than just one as arguments to `-1', `-2', and
`-j'.  You should make sure that the number of key fields is the same.

   Another feature is that the second input file can actually be as
many files as you want.  That way you can avoid putting the records
from several files together if not otherwise necessary.

3 How `combine' Processes Files
*******************************

The base of `combine' reads records from a data file (or a series of
them in a row) and if there is an output request for data records, it
writes the requested fields out to a file or to `stdout'.  Here is an
example of this most simple version of events.

     combine --write-output --output-fields=1-

This is essentially an expensive pipe.  It reads from `stdin' and
writes the entire record back to `stdout'.

   Introducing a reference file gives more options.  Now `combine' reads
the reference file into memory before reading the data file.  For every
data record, `combine' then checks to see if it has a match.  The
following example limits the simple pipe above by restricting the output
to those records from `stdin' that share the first 10 bytes in common
with a record in the reference file.

     combine -w -o 1- -r reference_file.txt --key-fields=1-10 \
                 --data-key-fields=1-10 --unique

Note that the option `--unique' is used here to prevent more than one
copy of a key from being stored by `combine'.  Without it, duplicate
keys in the reference file, when matched, would result in more than one
copy of the matching data record.

   The other option with a reference file is to have output based on the
records in that file, with indicators of how the data file records were
able to match to them.  In the next example, the same match as above is
done, but this time we write out a record for every unique key, with a
flag set to `1' if it was matched by a data record or `0' otherwise.
It still reads the data records from `stdin' and writes the output
records to `stdout'.

     combine -r -f reference_file.txt -k 1-10 -m 1-10 -u -w -o 1-10

   Of course, you might want both sets of output at the same time: the
list of data records that matched the keys in the reference file and a
list of keys in the reference file with an indication of which ones were
matched.  In the prior two examples the two different kinds of output
were written to `stdout'.  You can still do that if you like, and then
do a little post-processing to determine where the data-based records
leave off and the reference-based records begins.  A simpler way,
however, is to let `combine' write the information to separate files.

   In the following example we combine the output specifications from
the prior two examples and give them each a filename.  Note that the
first one has a spelled-out `--output-file' while the second one uses
the shorter 1-letter option `-t'.

     combine -w -o 1- --output-file testdata.txt \
                 -r -f reference_file.txt -k 1-10 -m 1-10 \
                 -u -w -o 1-10 -t testflag.txt

4 Extending `combine'
*********************

If `combine' was built with Guile (GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent
Language for Extensibility), you can do anything you want (within
reason) to extend `combine'.  This would have been set up when
`combine' was compiled and installed on your computer.  In a number of
places, there are built-in opportunities to call Guile with the data
that is currently in process.  Using these options, you can use your
favorite modules or write your own functions in scheme to manipulate
the data and to adjust how `combine' operates on it.

   The most common method (in my current usage) of extending `combine'
is to alter the values of fields from the input files before they are
used for matching or for output.  This is done inside the field list by
adding the scheme statement after the range and precision.  This is
covered in the section on field specifications. *Note Field-specific
extensions: Field Specifiers, for details.

   Another useful option is the ability to initialize Guile with your
own program.  To do this, you can use the `--extension-init-file' (or
`-X') followed by a file name.  `combine' will load that scheme file
into Guile before any processing.  In that way your functions will be
available when you need them in the running of the program.  It
certainly beats writing something complicated on the command line.

   In addition, there are Guile modules included in the distribution,
which can be used in extension scripts.

* Menu:

* Extension Options::
* Guile Modules::


File: combine.info,  Node: Extension Options,  Next: Guile Modules,  Up: Extending combine

4.1 Extension Options
=====================

The remaining extensibility options are called at various points in the
program: when it starts, when a file is started, when a match is found,
when a record is read, when a record is written, when a file is closed,
and at the very end of the program.  The options are listed below along
with the way to get access to the relevant data.

   The various non-field=specific options are as follows.  They all
occur as arguments to the option `--extension' (or `-x').

`lSCHEME-COMMAND'
     Filter records from the current file using the scheme command
     provided.  The scheme command must return `#t' (to keep processing
     the record) or `#f' (to ignore this record and move on to the
     next).  The variables `reference-field-n' or `data-field-n' will be
     available to the scheme command, depending on whether the record
     to be filtered is from the data file or a reference file.  In the
     variable names `n' represents the number of the specified output
     field, numbered from 1.

`mSCHEME-COMMAND'
     Validate a proposed match using the scheme command provided.  The
     scheme command must return `#t' (to confirm that this is a good
     match) or `#f' (to tell `combine' that this is not a match).  The
     variables `reference-field-n' and `data-field-n' will be available
     to the scheme command from the reference and data records involved
     in a particular match.  In the variable names `n' represents the
     number of the specified output field, numbered from 1.  The
     extension specification affects the match between the data file
     and the last named reference file.

`hSCHEME-COMMAND'
     Validate a proposed match between two records in the same
     hierarchy using the scheme command provided.  The scheme command
     must return `#t' (to confirm that this is a good match) or `#f'
     (to tell `combine' that this is not a match).  The variables
     `reference-field-n' and `prior-reference-field-n' will be
     available to the scheme command from the prior and current
     reference records involved in a particular match.  In the variable
     names `n' represents the number of the specified output field,
     numbered from 1.  The extension specification affects the match
     while traversing the hierarchs in the last named reference file.

`rSCHEME-COMMAND'
     Modify a record that has just been read using the scheme command
     provided.  The scheme command must return a string, which will
     become the new value of the input record to be processed.  The
     input record iteself can be referred to in the scheme command by
     using the variable `input-record' in the scheme command at the
     right place.  The records affected by this option are the records
     from the most recently named reference file, or from the data file
     if no reference file has yet been named.

   As an example, consider that you may have received a file from
someone who strips all the trailing spaces from the end of a record,
but you need to treat it with a fixed-width record layout.  Assuming
that you have defined a scheme function `rpad' in the initialization
file `util.scm', you can use the following command to get at the field
in positions 200-219, with spaces in place of the missing rest of the
record.

     combine -X util.scm -x 'r(rpad input-record 219 #\space)' \
                 -o 200-219 trimmed_file.txt

The same syntax works with the other `--extension' options.

4.2 Guile Modules
=================

Here we talk about Guile modules that are distributed with `combine'.
At the moment, those are limited to date processing.

   In addition, the file `util.scm' in the distribution contains a few
functions I have found handy.  They are not documented here, and the
file doesn't get installed automatically.

* Menu:

* Calendar Functions::
* Calendar Reference::
* Calendar Parsing::


File: combine.info,  Node: Calendar Functions,  Next: Calendar Reference,  Up: Guile Modules

4.2.1 Calendar Functions
------------------------

Included in the `combine' package are two Guile modules to work with
dates from a number of calendars, both obscure and common.  The basis
for them is the set of calendar functions that are shipped with Emacs.

   The reason that these functions deserve special notice here is that
date comparisons are a common type of comparison that often cannot be
made directly on a character string.  For example I might have trouble
knowing if "20030922" is the same date as "22 September 2003" if I
compared strings; however, comparing them as dates allows me to find a
match.  We can even compare between calendars, ensuring that "1 Tishri
5764" is recognized as the same date as "20030927".

   The calendar module can be invoked as `(use-modules (combine_scm
calendar))'.  It provides functions for converting from a variety of
calendars to and from and absolute date count, whose 0-day is the
imaginary date 31 December 1 B.C.  In the functions, the absolute date
is treated as a single number, and the dates are lists of numbers in
`(month day year)' format unless otherwise specified.

   The calendar functions are as follow:

   * calendar-absolute-from-julian

   * calendar-julian-from-absolute

   * calendar-absolute-from-islamic

   * calendar-islamic-from-absolute

   * calendar-absolute-from-hebrew

   * calendar-hebrew-from-absolute

   * calendar-absolute-from-chinese `(cycle year month day)'

   * calendar-chinese-from-absolute `(cycle year month day)'

   * calendar-absolute-from-french

   * calendar-french-from-absolute

   * calendar-absolute-from-coptic

   * calendar-coptic-from-absolute

   * calendar-absolute-from-ethiopic

   * calendar-ethiopic-from-absolute

   * calendar-absolute-from-iso `(week day year)'

   * calendar-iso-from-absolute `(week day year)'

   * calendar-absolute-from-persian

   * calendar-persian-from-absolute

   * calendar-mayan-long-count-from-absolute `(baktun katun tun uinal
     kin)'

   * calendar-mayan-haab-from-absolute `(day . month)'

   * calendar-mayan-tzolkin-from-absolute `(day . name)'

   * calendar-absolute-from-445fiscal `(month workday year)'

   * calendar-445fiscal-from-absolute `(month workday year)'

`gregorian-month-name-alist'
     An associative list giving the months in the Gregorian calendar in

     composed of a 2-letter language code (lowercase) and a list of 12
     month names.

4.2.3 Calendar Parsing
----------------------

The calendar parsing module can be invoked as `(use-modules
(combine_scm parse))'.

   The most useful function in the module is `parse-date'.  It takes as
arguments a date string and an output format.  The date string is
parsed as well as possible in descending order of preference for format
in case of ambiguity.  The function returns the date triplet (or other
such representation) suggested by the format string.

   The supported format strings are the words in the function names of
the form `calendar-xxxx-from-absolute' that would take the place of the
`xxxx'.  *Note Calendar Functions::, for more information.

   The parsing of the date string depends on the setting of a couple of
variables.  Look inside the file `parse.scm' for details.  The list
PARSE-DATE-EXPECTED-ORDER lists the order in which the parser should
look for the year, month, and day in case of ambiguity.  The list
PARSE-DATE-METHOD-PREFERENCE give more general format preferences, such
as 8-digit, delimited, or a word for the month and the expected incoming
calendar.

   Here are a few examples of passing a date and putting it out in some
formats:

     guile> (use-modules (combine_scm parse))
     guile> (parse-date "27 September 2003" "gregorian")
     (9 27 2003)
     guile> (parse-date "27 September 2003" "julian")
     (9 14 2003)

   The 13 day difference in the calendars is the reason that the
Orthodox Christmas is 2 weeks after the Roman Catholic Christmas.

     guile> (parse-date "27 September 2003" "hebrew")
     (7 1 5764)

   Note that the Hebrew date is Rosh HaShannah, the first day of the
year 5764.  The reason that the month is listed as 7 rather than 1 is
inherited from the Emacs calendar implementation.  Using the month list
in CALENDAR-HEBREW-MONTH-NAME-ARRAY-COMMON-YEAR or
CALENDAR-HEBREW-MONTH-NAME-ARRAY-LEAP-YEAR correctly gives "Tishri", but
since the extra month (in years that have it) comes mid-year, the
programming choice that I carried forward was to cycle the months
around so that the extra month would come at the end of the list.

     guile> (parse-date "27 September 2003" "islamic")
     (7 30 1424)
     guile> (parse-date "27 September 2003" "iso")
     (39 6 2003)

   This is the 6th day (Saturday) of week 39 of the year.

     guile> (parse-date "27 September 2003" "mayan-long-count")
     (12 19 10 11 7)

   I won't get into the detail, but the five numbers reflect the date in
the Mayan calendar as currently understood.

   Generally, I'd recommend using the more specific functions if you
are sure of the date format you expect.  For comparing dates, I would
further recommend comparing the absolute day count rather than any more
formatted format.

5 Applying combine
******************

There are lots of ways to apply `combine' to problems that will pop up
in the course of day-to-day life.  (Of course this fits into your
day-to-day life a bit more if you have a job or hobby that regularly
puts you into contact with data files.)

   Here are a few topics explored in more detail.

* Rearranging fields::
* Aggregation::

File: combine.info,  Node: Rearranging fields,  Next: Aggregation,  Up: Applying combine

5.1 Rearranging Fields
======================

When you do not use any reference files, `combine' still gives you the
opportunity to create a new record layout based on the records you read.

   This is an advantage over the `cut' utility because while `cut' only
allows you to omit portions of the record, `combine' also allows you to
reorder those fields you keep and to add a constant field somewhere in
the order.  In addition, `combine' gives you the chance to convert
between fixed-width and delimited formats, where `cut' keeps the format
you started with (although the GNU version does let you change
delimiters).

   Clearly, flexible tools like `awk' or `sed' or any programming
language will also make this kind of thing (and with a little work
anything `combine' can do) possible.  It may be that they are a more
efficient choice, but I have never tested it.

   As an example, here is a fixed width file, which contains in its
record layout some address book information.  If I need to make a
tab-delimited file of names and phone numbers to upload into my mobile
phone, I can use the command that follows to get the output I want.

     $ cat testadd.txt
     2125551212Doe       John      123 Main StreetNew York  NY10001
     2025551212Doe       Mary      123 Main StreetWashingtonDC20001
     3015551212Doe       Larry     123 Main StreetLaurel    MD20707
     6175551212Doe       Darryl    123 Main StreetBoston    MA02115
     6035551212Doe       Darryl    123 Main StreetManchesterNH02020

   Here is a command that grabs the first and last name and the phone
number and tacks the word "Home" on the end so that my phone marks the
number with a little house.(1)

   Note that the statistics and the output all show up on the screen if
you do not say otherwise.  The statistics are on `stderr' and the
output on `stdout', so you can redirect them differently.  You can also
use the option `--output-file' (or `-t') to provide an output file, and
you can suppress the statistics if you want with `--no-statistics'.

     % combine --write-output --output-field-delimiter="	" \
               --output-fields=21-30,11-20,1-10 \
               --output-constant="Home" testadd.txt
     Statistics for data file testadd.txt
       Number of records read:                            5
       Number of records dropped by filter:               0
       Number of records matched on key:                  5
       Number of records written:                         5
     John	Doe	2125551212	Home
     Mary	Doe	2025551212	Home
     Larry	Doe	3015551212	Home
     Darryl	Doe	6175551212	Home
     Darryl	Doe	6035551212	Home

   The delimiter between the quotes and in the output was a tab
character, and it worked, but in some formats it comes out in a space
when printed.

   For reference, here is a comparable SQL query that would select the
same data assuming a table were set up containing the data in the file
above.

     SELECT First_Name, Last_Name, Phone_Number, 'Home'
       FROM Address_Book;

   A comparable `gawk' program would be something like this.

     BEGIN {OFS = "\t"}
     {
       print substr ($0, 21, 10), substr ($0, 11, 10), substr ($0, 1, 10), "Home";
       }

5.2 Aggregation
===============

One feature of `combine' is aggregation.  In other words, based on a
set of keys in a data file, create a new file containing a summary
record for each unique combination of values that appears in those keys.

   This is a special case of reference-file based output in that the
reference file and the data file are the same file.  We are using it
both to build the list of keys and to provide the values to summarize.

   Here is a simple example.  Suppose my 4-year-old were flipping
Sacajawea(1) dollar coins and recording the results, along with the
time and the date.  A portion of the resulting file might look like
this:

     Monday	27 Oct 2003	14:02:01	Head	1.00
     Monday	27 Oct 2003	14:03:05	Head	1.00
     Monday	27 Oct 2003	14:03:55	Tail	1.00
     Monday	27 Oct 2003	14:04:30	Head	1.00
     Monday	27 Oct 2003	14:06:12	Tail	1.00
     Monday	27 Oct 2003	14:08:43	Head	1.00
     Monday	27 Oct 2003	14:54:52	Head	1.00
     Monday	27 Oct 2003	19:59:59	Tail	1.00
     Tuesday	28 Oct 2003	08:02:01	Tail	5.00
     Tuesday	28 Oct 2003	08:02:16	Tail	5.00
     Tuesday	28 Oct 2003	08:02:31	Head	5.00
     Tuesday	28 Oct 2003	08:02:46	Tail	5.00
     Wednesday	29 Oct 2003	12:02:09	Head	10.00

   Then if I wanted to measure her daily performance, I could count the
number of coin flips per day, with the following command.

   The option `--data-is-reference' tells the program to read the file
only once, bulding the list of keys as it goes.  This is useful for
aggregations, and it requires that the key fields be the same and that
we only keep one copy of each key (with the `--unique' option).

   The records come out in an unspecified order.  If you require a
specific order, you can pipe the result through the `sort' command.

     % combine --input-field-delimiter="	" --data-is-reference \
               --count --reference-file=testcoin.txt \
               --output-field-delimiter="," -D "	" \
               --key-fields=2 --data-key-fields=2 --write-output \
               --output-fields=2 --unique testcoin.txt

     Statistics for reference file testcoin.txt
       Number of records read:                           13
       Number of records dropped by filter:               0
       Number of records stored:                          3
       Number of records matched on key:                  3
       Number of records matched fully:                   3
       Number of reference-data matches:                 13

   An equivalent SQL statement, assuming that the table has been created
would be.

     SELECT Date, COUNT (Result)
       FROM Coinflip
       GROUP BY Date;

   If she wanted to count the number of heads and tails, and also the
amount she bet on each, she could do the following.  (I have shortened
the options you have already seen to their 1-byte equivalents.)

   The specification of the field to sum says to keep 2 decimal places.
`combine' works with integers if you don't say otherwise.  The option
`--counter-size' tells the program to use at least that many bytes to
present counters and sums.

     % combine -D "	" -M -n --sum-fields=5.2 --counter-size=8 \
               -r testcoin.txt -d "," -D "	" -k 4 -m 4 -w -o 4 \
               -u testcoin.txt
     Head,       7,   20.00
     Tail,       6,   18.00
     Statistics for reference file testcoin.txt
       Number of records read:                           13
       Number of records dropped by filter:               0
       Number of records stored:                          2
       Number of records matched on key:                  2
       Number of records matched fully:                   2
       Number of reference-data matches:                 13

   An equivalent SQL statement, assuming again that the table has been
created would be.

     SELECT Result, COUNT (Result), Sum (Wager)
       FROM Coinflip
       GROUP BY Result;

but these and the older Susan B. Anthony coins still show up.

5.3 Finding Changes
===================

If you get the same file again and again, and you want to see what's
different, the canonical method is to use the `diff' command.  It will
list for you those records that are unique to each file, and those that
appear to have changed.  One drawback is that it requires the records
in the two files to be in the same order.  Another is that it does not
pay attention to the key fields that may be important to you.

   When I want to find the changes in a file, including additions,
deletions, and any changes for the information about a key I normally
use 4 applications of `combine'.  One command is suffucuent to find the
new keys.  One is enough to find those that are no longer there.  A
third finds everything that is different, and the fourth finds the
before and after image of keys whose information has changed.

   As an example, suppose my bridge club's roster has a name and a phone
number, separated by commas, for each member.  The following four
commands will identify the new members, the departed members, and those
whose phone number has changed.

     %# Reference file is optional, so unmatched data records will have
     %# 2 blank fields at the end.
     % combine -D , -d , -w -o 1-2 -r old_roster.txt -D , -k 1 -m 1 -p \
               -o 1-2 inew_roster.txt | grep -v ' , $' > new_member.txt
     %# Data file is optional, so unmatched reference records will have
     %# 2 blank fields at the beginning.
     % combine -D , -d , -p -w -o 1-2 -r old_roster.txt -D , -k 1 -m 1 \
               -o 1-2 inew_roster.txt | grep -v '^ , ' > departed_member.txt
     %# Both files are optional, so any unmatched records will have
     %# blank fields at the beginning or end.  Here we match on the
     %#entire record rather than the key as in the above two examples.
     % combine -D , -d , -p -w -o 1-2 -r old_roster.txt -D , \
               -k 1-2 -m 1-2 -o 1-2 -p inew_roster.txt | grep -v ' , ' \
               > all_changes.txt
     %# Match up the before and after versions of an entry to see changes.
     % combine -D , -d , -w -o 1-2 -r all_changes.txt -D , -k 3 -m 1 -o 2 \
               all_changes.txt | grep -v ' , ' > changed_member.txt
   TO BE CONTINUED


File: combine.info,  Node: Hierarchies,  Prev: Finding changes,  Up: Applying combine

5.4 Hierarchies
===============

A hierarchy tends to be an organization where there is a directional
one-to-many relationship between parent records and their associated
children.  `combine' works with hierarchies within reference files when
the file has a record for each node and each record points to its
parent in the hierarchy.

   Because the hierarchy is assumed to be stored in a reference file, it
is accessed by matching to a data record.  Once an individual reference
record has been matched to the data record, its relationship to other
records within the hierarchy is followed through the hierarchy until
there is no further to go.

   The standard process is to assume that the key that matched to the
data file key is at the top of the hierarchy.  When traversing the
hierarchy, `combine' looks for the key on the current record in the
hierarchy key of other reference records.  This repeats until there are
no further linkages from one record to the next.  For each record that
is linked to the hierarchy, that record is treated as a reference
record that matched the data record.

   In this section, we'll use the following hierarchy file.  It is a
simple hierarchy tree with `Grandfather' as the top node and 2 levels of
entries below.

     Grandfather,
     Father,Grandfather
     Uncle,Grandfather
     Me,Father
     Brother,Father
     Cousin,Uncle

   If my data file consisted only of a record with the key
`Grandfather', then the following command would result in the records
listed after it.  Each record written includes the entry itself and its
parent.

     combine -D ',' -w -d ',' -r test1.tmp -k 1 -m 1 -a 2 -D ',' \
             -o 1-2 test2.tmp

     Grandfather,
     Father,Grandfather
     Me,Father
     Brother,Father
     Uncle,Grandfather
     Cousin,Uncle

   If we are only interested in the endpoints (in this case all the
lowest-level descendants of `Grandfather'), we can use the option `-l'.

     combine -D ',' -w -d ',' -r test1.tmp -k 1 -m 1 -a 2 -D ',' -o 1 \
             -l test2.tmp

     Me
     Brother
     Cousin

   We can arrive at the same number of records, each containing the
entire hierarchy traversed to get to the leaf nodes, by using the
option `--flatten-hierarchy' (`-F').  This option takes a number as an
argument, and then includes information from that many records found in
traversing the hierarchy, starting from the record that matched the
data record.  This example tells `combine' to report three levels from
the matching `Grandfather' record.

     combine -D ',' -w -d ',' -r test1.tmp -k 1 -m 1 -a 2 -D ',' -o 1 \
             -F 3 test2.tmp

     Grandfather,Father,Me
     Grandfather,Father,Brother
     Grandfather,Uncle,Cousin

   As with other areas within `combine', the hierarchy manipulation is
extensible through Guile.  The key fields can be modified as with any
other fields.  *Note Field-specific extensions: Field Specifiers, for
details.  The matches within the hierarchy can be further filtered,
using the `h' suboption of the option `-x'.  (*note Extending
combine::.)  As with matches between reference records and data this
filtering can allow you to perform fuzzy comparisons, to do more complex
calculations to filter the match, or to decide when you have gone far
enough and would like to stop traversing the hierarchy.

6 Future Work
*************

Here is a short list of things that we think will be useful in the near
future:

   Indexed files.  Add the ability to work with a reference file
through an index rather than loading the whole thing into a hash table.
Open questions are the format of the index and whether to put the entire
index into memory, or work with it from disk.

     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
