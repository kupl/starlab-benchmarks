	<donaldp@sco.COM>.

1998-06-23  Markku Rossi  <mtr@ngs.fi>

	* afmparse.c (afm_parse_file): Added +1's to the memory
	allocations to avoid zero allocations.  There are some AFM files
	available that say, for example, "StartComposites 0".  That used
	to fail on some systems which memory allocation routines do not
	like zero allocations.

	* afm.h: Added ISO-8859/7 encoding.  Thanks to Manolis Lourakis
	<lourakis@csd.uch.gr>.

	compilation problems from this library.

1997-12-30  Markku Rossi  <mtr@ngs.fi>

	* afm.c (afm_font_stringwidth): Fixed cast bug where char was cast
	to unsigned int.
	(afm_font_charwidth): Changed <ch> argument's type to `char' and
	changed the cast to `unsigned char'.

	* afm.h: Changed <ch> argument's type of afm_font_charwidth() to
	`char'.

 	stdout.

1995-10-20  Markku Rossi  <mtr@ngs.fi>

	* afmparse.c (read_character_metrics): some AFM files give too big
 	count for the StartCharMetrics keyword, do not concider it as a
 	syntax error.
