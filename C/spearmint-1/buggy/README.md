**Spearmint** is a fork of [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) with two main goals; 1) provide a flexible engine for creating new games and mods, 2) support features from (and running) various id Tech 3-based games.

Spearmint can be used to play Quake III Arena, Quake III: Team Arena, and Turtle Arena. Progress has been made toward running Return to Castle Wolfenstein (MP) and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory but there is still quite a bit left before it's possible. Spearmint is not compatible with existing mods (the QVM/DLL files) or demos (game recordings) for any game.

New Spearmint major releases (X.0.0) will break VM and network compatibility with previous releases.

The source code for the Spearmint Quake 3 game, cgame, and ui code and QVM compiler is at [zturtleman/mint-arena](https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/). Map editor and map compiler are available at https://icculus.org/gtkradiant/.
