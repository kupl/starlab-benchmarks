 * Interface for reading <code>{@link Definition}</code> from a source.

 * <code>{@link Definition}</code> objects from a source.  Implementations
 * should define what the source is, whether it be a persistent store such as a
 * configuration file or database, or something like a web service.  The
 * DefinitionsReader is responsible for reading from a single location.  It does
 * not perform any internationalization duties or inheritance of Definitions.
 * It only reads from the source and returns a Map of objects read.</p>
