/**
 * <p>The interface for an expression-language validator and evaluator.
 * Classes that implement an expression language expose their functionality
 * via this interface.</p>
 * <p>The validate() and evaluate() methods must be thread-safe.  That is,
 * multiple threads may call these methods on the same ExpressionEvaluator
 * object simultaneously.  Implementations should synchronize access if
 * they depend on transient state.  Implementations should not, however,
 * assume that only one object of each ExpressionEvaluator type will be
 * instantiated; global caching should therefore be static.  No release()
 * mechanism or robust lifecycle is specified, for language-interpreter
 * pluggability is experimental in EA2.</p>
 * <p><b>WARNING</b>:  This class supports experimentation for the EA2
 * release of JSTL; it is not expected to be part of the final RI or
 * specification.</p>
