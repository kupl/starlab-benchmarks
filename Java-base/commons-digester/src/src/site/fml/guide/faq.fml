            <question>Why do I get warnings when using a JAXP 1.1 parser?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>If you're using a JAXP 1.1 parser, you might see the following warning (in your log):</p>
<source>
[WARN] Digester - -Error: JAXP SAXParser property not recognized: http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage
</source>
<p>This property is needed for JAXP 1.2 (XML Schema support) as required
for the Servlet Spec. 2.4 but is not recognized by JAXP 1.1 parsers.
This warning is harmless.</p>

        <faq id="schema_validation_out_box">
            <question>Why Doesn't Schema Validation Work With Parser XXX Out Of The Box?</question>
            <answer><p>
Schema location and language settings are often need for validation using schemas.
Unfortunately, there isn't a single standard approach to how these properties are
configured on a parser.
Digester tries to guess the parser being used and configure it appropriately
but it's not infallible.
You might need to grab an instance, configure it and pass it to Digester.
</p>
<p>
If you want to support more than one parser in a portable manner, 
then you'll probably want to take a look at the 
<code>org.apache.commons.digester.parsers</code> package
and add a new class to support the particular parser that's causing problems.

        <faq id="help">
            <question>Help! 
I'm Validating Against Schema But Digester Ignores Errors!</question>
            <answer><p>
Digester is based on <a href="http://www.saxproject.org">SAX</a>. The convention for
SAX parsers is that all errors are reported (to any registered 
<code>ErrorHandler</code>) but processing continues. Digester (by default) 
registers its own <code>ErrorHandler</code> implementation. This logs details 
but does not stop the processing (following the usual convention for SAX 
based processors). 
</p>
<p>
This means that the errors reported by the validation of the schema will appear in the
Digester logs but the processing will continue. To change this behaviour, call
<code>digester.setErrorHandler</code> with a more suitable implementation.

        <faq id="example_code">
            <question>Where Can I Find Example Code?</question>
            <answer><p>Digester ships with a sample application: a mapping for the <em>Rich Site 
Summary</em> format used by many newsfeeds. Download the source distribution 
to see how it works.</p>
<p>Digester also ships with a set of examples demonstrating most of the 
features described in this document. See the "src/examples" subdirectory 
of the source distribution.</p></answer>

        <faq id="support_rich_site">
            <question>When Are You Going To Support <em>Rich Site Summary</em> Version x.y.z?</question>
            <answer><p>The <em>Rich Site Summary</em> application is intended to be a sample application. 
It works but we have no plans to add support for other versions of the format.
</p>
<p>
We would consider donations of standard digester applications but it's unlikely that
these would ever be shipped with the base digester distribution.

        <faq id="upgrade_digester3">
          <question>Does my old Digester 2.X code continue working once upgraded to Digester 3?</question>
          <answer>No, class imports have to be updated to org.apache.commons.digester3 otherwise Digester and Rule classes won't be found.
          Old XML Rules and Annotations rule extensions are not 100% compatible, please refer to related documentation.</answer>
