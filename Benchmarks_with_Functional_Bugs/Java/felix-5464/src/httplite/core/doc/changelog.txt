Changes from 0.1.2 to 0.1.4
---------------------------

** Bug
	* fix regression in resource path resolution code in test cases.
	* put 'shutdown server on last client deregistration' optimization in a thread and wait 30 seconds before checking if no clients are registered.  Fixes issue in which sole client "bounces" registration service on start and causes deadlock in server.
	* fix bad formatting of ASF license header clobbered by Eclipse formatter.
	* Use consistent names in DEPS/NOTICE files.
	* [FELIX-3266] - PrintWriter in HttpServletResponse does not send string content to client
	* [FELIX-3253] - Fails to resolve urls with multiple successive path separators
	* [FELIX-3256] - Remove Ant build file from Lightweight HTTP Service bundle.
	
** Improvement
	* : [FELIX-3291] - added cookie support
	* : [FELIX-3287] - Support Java 1.3 with provided by patch from Yann Diorcet. 
    * : ignore socket exceptions when server is explicitly shutdown.
    * : [FELIX-3276] - create 'minimal' and 'complete' targets.  'complete' target includes servlet and osgi dependencies.
	* : javadoc additions to public methods.
