/**
 * Annotates an Aspect service. Aspects allow you to define an interceptor, or chain of interceptors 
 * for a service (to add features like caching or logging, etc ...). The dependency manager intercepts 
 * the original service, and allows you to execute some code before invoking the original service ...
 * The aspect will be applied to any service that matches the specified interface and filter and 
 * will be registered with the same interface and properties as the original service, plus any 
 * extra properties you supply here. It will also inherit all dependencies, 
 * and if you declare the original service as a member it will be injected.
 * 
 * <p> For "add", "change", "remove" callbacks, the following method signatures are supported:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference ref, Service service)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference ref, Object service)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference ref)
 * (Component comp, Service service)
 * (Component comp, Object service)
 * (Component comp)
 * (Component comp, Map properties, Service service)
 * (ServiceReference ref, Service service)
 * (ServiceReference ref, Object service)
 * (ServiceReference ref)
 * (Service service)
 * (Service service, Map propeerties)
 * (Map properties, Service, service)
 * (Service service, Dictionary properties)
 * (Dictionary properties, Service service)
 * (Object service)
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p> For "swap" callbacks, the following method signatures are supported:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * (Service old, Service replace)
 * (Object old, Object replace)
 * (ServiceReference old, Service old, ServiceReference replace, Service replace)
 * (ServiceReference old, Object old, ServiceReference replace, Object replace)
 * (Component comp, Service old, Service replace)
 * (Component comp, Object old, Object replace)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference old, Service old, ServiceReference replace, Service replace)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference old, Object old, ServiceReference replace, Object replace)
 * (ServiceReference old, ServiceReference replace)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference old, ServiceReference replace)
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * 
 * <p> Here, the AspectService is registered into the OSGI registry each time an InterceptedService
 * is found from the registry. The AspectService class intercepts the InterceptedService, and decorates
 * its "doWork()" method. This aspect uses a rank with value "10", meaning that it will intercept some
 * other eventual aspects with lower ranks. The Aspect also uses a service property (param=value), and 
 * include eventual service properties found from the InterceptedService:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * 
 * &#64;AspectService(ranking=10))
 * &#64;Property(name="param", value="value")
 * class AspectService implements InterceptedService {
 *     // The service we are intercepting (injected by reflection)
 *     protected InterceptedService intercepted;
 *   
 *     public void doWork() {
 *        intercepted.doWork();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
