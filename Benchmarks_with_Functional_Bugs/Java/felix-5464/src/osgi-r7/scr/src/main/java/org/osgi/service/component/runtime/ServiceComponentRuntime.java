/**
 * The {@code ServiceComponentRuntime} service represents the Declarative
 * Services actor, known as Service Component Runtime (SCR), that manages the
 * service components and their life cycle. The {@code ServiceComponentRuntime}
 * service allows introspection of the components managed by Service Component
 * Runtime.
 * <p>
 * This service differentiates between a {@link ComponentDescriptionDTO} and a
 * {@link ComponentConfigurationDTO}. A {@link ComponentDescriptionDTO} is a
 * representation of a declared component description. A
 * {@link ComponentConfigurationDTO} is a representation of an actual instance
 * of a declared component description parameterized by component properties.
 * <p>
 * This service must be registered with a {@link Constants#SERVICE_CHANGECOUNT}
 * service property that must be updated each time the SCR DTOs available from
 * this service change.
 * <p>
 * Access to this service requires the
 * {@code ServicePermission[ServiceComponentRuntime, GET]} permission. It is
 * intended that only administrative bundles should be granted this permission
 * to limit access to the potentially intrusive methods provided by this
 * service.
