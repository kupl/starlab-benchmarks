  . It now possible to jump several records while navigating
    using a prefix argument to the next/previous commands.

  . Support for joins and foreign keys.
  . Grouping records by one or more fields.

    rec_db_set.
  . Documentation in the rec.h header file extended and improved.
* Emacs mode:

 Version 1.5 (13 January 2012)
* The utilities will now ask interactively for a password if it was
  not provided with the -s command line option.  This avoids security
  problems related to shell history files.
* Support for octal and hexadecimal numbers has been added.  They can
  be used in both the records and selection expressions.
* It is now possible to select a given number of random records in
  many of the utilities using the -m command line option.
* The -n option now accepts a list of indexes, supporting ranges.
* The new -U (uniq) option for recsel removes duplicated fields in the
  output records.
* The new -q (quick) option allows to quickly search for the desired
  record without having to provide a complete selection expression.
* Auto generated fields are now considered integers by default.  This
  avoids repetitive patterns in record descriptors involving %auto and
  %type.
* Tab characters are now allowed in blank lines betwwen records.
* The API in rec.h is now better documented with comments, and
  improved.
* recfix now exits with an error status if there is a parse error in
  some input file.
* The usage of the internal data structures has been _vastly_
  improved, resulting in a much faster operation.
* Internal cleanup and code factorization.
* Many, many, many bug fixes :D

 Version 1.4 (03 November 2011)
* Support for encryption with the new %confidential special field.
* Support for named types with the new %typedef special field.
* Support for sorting with the new %sort special field.
* Recutils support for org-babel is now included in the distribution
  as ob-rec.el.  It allows to read rec data into org documents in both
  raw and table formats.
* It is now possible to use double quotes for delimiting string
  literals in selection expressions, as well as single quotes.
  Unescapted newline characters are also supported.
* The manual has been vastly improved.
* recfix now supports several operations: check, sort, encrypt and
  decrypt.
* recins now generates parseable locale independent dates when
  generating time-stamps in auto-fields.
* Lots of bug fixes.

 Version 1.3 (11 February 2011)
* A quite bad (and embarrassing) bug introduced in 1.2 has been
  fixed.  The bug was causing recins, recdel and recset to report
  random integrity failures, due to a uninitialized variable.
* New special field %size, that allows to define constraints in the
  size of record sets.

  in macos x has been fixed.

* Support for auto-incremented fields and timestamps with the new
  %auto field in record descriptors.

  or else add it to the record.
* The flavor of regular expressions accepted in both selection
  expressions and type descriptions is now documented in the user
  manual.
* Translations for German, Finnish, Swedish and Dutch.
* recdel now performs an integrity check before to complete the
  deletion.

  in the local ones.

  that is being modified.

  . New date operators: before (<<), after (>>) and sametime (==).

  following systems:
