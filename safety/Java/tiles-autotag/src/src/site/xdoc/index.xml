            <p>Tiles-3 introduces a feature complete
                <a href="http://svn.eu.apache.org/repos/asf/tiles/sandbox/trunk/tiles-autotag/" title="Autotag SVN directory">Autotag project</a>,
                a project that automatically generates tags (or tag-like) artifact from a common template code for a range of templating languages.
                Today JSP tags, Freemarker directive models and Velocity directives are generated from a common template models.
            </p>
            <p>Such template models must have a single public method, with this signature:</p>
            <p>
                <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">public void execute(&lt;parameters&gt;, Request request, ModelBody modelBody);</span>&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>The modelBody parameter is optional: if it is not specified, the template model does not have a body.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For more features (required fields, default values, a name different to the one specified in the parameter list) a new annotation @Parameter has been created.</p>
            <p>A Maven 2 (based on 2.2.1) plugin contains four Mojos:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the first mojo (create-descriptor) reads the template models and produces an XML file containing the description of the read models;</li>
                <li>the others (generate-jsp, generate-freemarker, generate-velocity) produce boilerplate code.</li>
            </ul>
                <p>The projects using the latter mojos must include some runtime dependencies.</p>
                <p>The boilerplate code has been removed and uses the plugin instead: it's a lot of boilerplate, boring code, now generated automatically.
                </p>
