Using File Name Mapping

 It might be necessary to customize the file name of libraries and TLDs. By default, those resources are stored
 using the following pattern:

+-----
@{artifactId}@-@{version}@.@{extension}@
+-----

 If the artifact has a classifier the default pattern is of course:

+-----
@{artifactId}@-@{version}@-@{classifier}@.@{extension}@
+-----

 The <<<outputFileNameMapping>>> parameter allows you to give a custom pattern. Each token defined in the
 pattern will be replaced with a value from the current artifact. You can use any property of Artifact and
 ArtifactHandler as a token. There is also a special token named <<<dashClassifier?>>> that can be used, since 2.1.
 It will add the string "-yourclassifier" if and only if the artifact has a classifier.

 For instance, to store the libraries and TLDs without version numbers or classifiers, use the following pattern:

+-----
@{artifactId}@.@{extension}@
+-----

 To store the libraries and TLDs without version numbers but with classifiers
 (if they exist), use the following pattern:

+-----
@{artifactId}@@{dashClassifier?}@.@{extension}@
+-----
