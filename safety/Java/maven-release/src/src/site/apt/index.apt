*----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| {{{./maven-release-manager/}maven-release-manager}}      | core classes
*----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+

Notes for Developers

  There are tests in this project which require you to set the M2_HOME
  environment variable. Since many of the tests print error messages,
  it is easy to forget about this and then be puzzled.
